“Andrew the Declarative Robot: A Paradigm Shift in Automation”

Andrew the Smart Robot: A New Way to Get Things Done

Meet Andrew, your personal robot. Imagine having a helpful companion who effortlessly handles household tasks, from cleaning to cooking. But what makes Andrew truly remarkable? It’s his unique approach: declarative behavior.

The Old Way: Step-by-Step Instructions

- In the past, we’d program robots with detailed commands: “Andrew, pick up the trash,” or “Andrew, follow this recipe for Lari Kebab.”

- But Andrew isn’t a child—he’s smart and intuitive. We shouldn’t micromanage him.

Declarative Behavior: What We Want, Not How to Do It

- With Andrew, we take a different route. We tell him what we need, not how to achieve it.

- When you say, “Andrew, clean the home,” he knows where the vacuum cleaner is and how to use it. No babysitting required.

Terraform by HashiCorp: Andrew’s Cousin in Infrastructure Provisioning

- Terraform, like Andrew, thinks declaratively. Instead of scripting every step, we define our desired state.

```
resource "azurerm_mssql_server" "server" {
  name                                 = "myname"
  version                              = "12.0"
  administrator_login                  = "admin"
  administrator_login_password         = "password"
  connection_policy                    = "Redirect"
  location                             = "West Germany"
  minimum_tls_version                  = "1.0"
  outbound_network_restriction_enabled = true
  public_network_access_enabled        = true
  resource_group_name                  = "rg-name"

  tags = {
    projectName = "demo"
    environment = "prod"
  }

  azuread_administrator {
    azuread_authentication_only = false
    login_username              = "email@tenant-domain.com"
    object_id                   = "6e7d20ea-06bc-4899-aabf-5705a9156bb3"
    tenant_id                   = "c472f664-5454-4a2c-af74-0663a89ea4ee"
  }
  identity {
    identity_ids = []
    type         = "SystemAssigned"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_mssql_database" "db" {
  name                           = var.dbName
  server_id                      = azurerm_mssql_server.server.id
  collation                      = "SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS"
  create_mode                    = "Default"
  maintenance_configuration_name = "SQL_Default"
  max_size_gb                    = 40
  read_replica_count             = 2
  sku_name                       = "S4"
  storage_account_type           = "Zone"

  tags = {
    projectName = "demo"
    environment = "prod"
  }

  short_term_retention_policy {
    backup_interval_in_hours = 24
    retention_days           = 7
  }
}

```

We declare properties, tags, and even the Azure AD administrator. Terraform handles the rest.

Conclusion: Terraform Unleashes Your Infrastructure Superpowers.

Andrew isn’t just a robot; he’s a glimpse into a future where simplicity meets efficiency. But what if I told you that Terraform takes this concept beyond household chores? It’s your secret weapon for managing cloud infrastructure.

Terraform’s Magic Wand:

- Declare your desired state, just like you do with Andrew. Describe your infrastructure needs, and Terraform makes it happen.
- No manual steps, no babysitting. Terraform provisions servers, databases, networks, and more—all from your declarative wishes.

So here’s to Andrew and Terraform—the dynamic duo simplifying our lives, whether at home or in the cloud! 🌟🤖🚀
