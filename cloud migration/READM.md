Migration Journey from on-premise to Microsoft Azure Cloud Computing:

Moving from traditional on-premise stuff onto Cloud Computing is game-changing technology like upgrading an old flip phone to smartphone.
With cloud computing, organizations can access to wide range of IT resources on-demand instantly over the Internet with the lowest costs and security risk.

- Why Migrate to Cloud:

  - reduce costs: In on-premise organizations spend money for the up-front costs of expensive infrastructures, servers, firewalls, software (Capital Expenditures or Cap-Ex), on the other hand in cloud, organization just pay for daily operations and usages (Operation Expenditures or Op-Ex). It saves money for other strategic investments.
  - fast time-to-market: Cloud computing helps to businesses’ agility to adopt to new needs, applications, and services quickly and safely. As experiences we have to implement an IoT solution, Azure provides enterprise IoT services to help business achieves goals in a fast and affordable way in this comparative market.
  - achieve scalability: Based on the services load and coming of new customers, cloud computing helps to scale up and down automatically and manually as needed with a few clicks.

  - Seamless Integration: If you're already using Microsoft products such as Microsoft SQL Server, Active Directory, and ... Azure fits right in and can save you money, plus it offers extra benefits to help you manage your services better.

- How to Migrate to Azure:
  There are a few solutions to make this switch:
  1. Cloud Solution: Migrate all on-premise services to a cloud provider.
  2. Hybrid Solution: Migrate some of them to cloud and remain rest of them on-premise.
  3. Multi-Cloud Solution: Migrate services onto different cloud provider such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Service (AWS), Google Cloud, and … depending on what kind of service organizations need.

Having a migration adoption strategy is the first thing you must have. Before you start moving stuff, make sure everyone important is okay with it. Pick a clear goal for why you're moving (like saving money or making customers happier) to get everyone excited and confident.
Write down what you want to achieve with the move, focusing on how it will help the whole team. Check if your team knows enough about Azure, and if not, teach them or get someone who knows to help.
Having everyone's support from the beginning will make sure your move goes well, even if there are problems.
